title: My Interview With the FWA
---

I remember stumbling across [the old FWA](http://web.archive.org/web/20050207104639/http://thefwa.com) site back in college and being mesmerized.

## My first love
*"I must do this,"* I thought to myself after seeing my first handful of FWA winners back in the early 2000s. The clever animations, objects floating around, etc. completely won me over. I simply *had* to learn how to do that. It wasn't a question. So I bought a bunch of Macromedia Flash MX books and got busy! Who cared about user experience and business objectives, I WANTED TO MAKE STUFF MOVE!

## Thanks Rob!
A big heartfelt thanks goes out to Rob Ford, for allowing me the pleasure of an interview on his site that gave me that surge of inspiration in my early days. Rob reached out after our [Singapore HeritageFest 360ยบ](http://www.thefwa.com/mobile/singapore-heritagefest-360-) won a FWA MOTD award.
