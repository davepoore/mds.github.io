title: Conferences I Plan To Attend in 2013
---

As a perpetual internet frequenter, online banter is aplenty but real conversations are lacking.

## 1. An Event Apart
Hotlanta is the first among the cities in the new year to host the "all official and what not" event put on by [Jeffery Zeldman ](http://zeldman.com) and [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com). The price tag of $1k+ is indeed a friction point considering all of the other smaller conferences available, but I've wanted to check it out for some time. If you've been before, drop me a line to talk me into or out of it.

## 2. Greenville Grok
[2012 Grok](http://studiomds.co/blog/greenville-grok) was an incredible experience and I expect 2013 to be no less. I'll attend again this year knowing more people and primed for maximum impact. Grok is a brainchild of [Matthew Smith](http://matthewsmith.cc), who just so happens to have my same awesome name.

## 3. Circles Conference
I met [Ish](http://ismaelburciaga.com) at Grok this year and missed out on his 2012 conference. Judging by the response it was a smashing hit. In 2013 I will break out my western-wear and head on over to Texas for some fun with Circles.

## <span class="strike">4. Brooklyn Beta</span>
I'm just assuming I won't get the elusive tickets for 2013, but if I do, attendance will be had.

## More Community in 2013
Beyond these conferences, I'm going to make a local effort in the new year to herd some creative cats near me on a regular basis. Athens is filled with creative individuals: musicians, photographers, fine artists, etc. plus it's only a hop, skip and a jump away from Atlanta.
