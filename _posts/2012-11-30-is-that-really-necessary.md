title: Is That Really Necessary
---

The thought hit me as I dipped my head into a sink full of water in my bathroom.

I had a towel in my hand to catch the cold drips once I was finished. As the crown of my head breached the water I quickly wrapped the dry towel around my soaked cranium to perform the usual shakedown.
        
You see, unless I've been working out, running, etc., I shower about 3 times per week. It's not that I'm against showering. I do like being clean but I don't always *need* a shower everyday. The only thing I miss from the shower is a wet head, which of course sets the stage for styling of the hair. If I don't style <sup><a href="#footnotes" class="fn">1</a></sup> my hair can get all puffy like [Bob Ross(http://cdn.stripersonline.com/1/13/1000x1000px-LL-1308e9f7_bob-ross.jpeg). Not that there's anything wrong with that.
        
I've found that this alternative method is a quick and easy way to accomplish what I need. It effectively removes bed-head and gives me a quick wake-up. This is all I need in between the days of showering.
        
I thought for a moment, "What else am I doing that isn't necessary?" or that could be replaced with a quicker and easier alternative.
        
## Stretching the Metaphor

This same thinking can be applied to design, development, and user-experience. Does that page *need* to have the full navigation on it? Does your new app *have* to have a Facebook-esque slider menu? Do you really *have* to include images in your email blasts or could a text only format work? Do those buttons really *need* gradients, inner shadows, drop shadows, and a stroke?

Sometimes the answer is yes, but I challenge you *(and myself)* to think, "Is that really necessary, right here, right now?"
