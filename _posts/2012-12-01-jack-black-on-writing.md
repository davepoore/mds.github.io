title: Jack Black on Writing
---

I recently heard this radio interview on NPR during a drive home from work.

>"You're going to have to do some writing. Let's face it. The great comedians now that are handicapped in the looks department are tremendous writers. I'm not gonna say who they are because now they'll be offended. But you know who you are. That's what I tell anyone who approaches me that wants a career like mine. I say, well you better get to the writing. I didn't really have anything going until I started writing songs and sketches for Tenacious D. It's not enough just to be an actor anymore, you have to bring a whole skill-set."
