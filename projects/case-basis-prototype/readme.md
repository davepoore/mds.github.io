#Case Basis Prototype
The purpose of this prototype is to show a rough version of a case timeline and catalog the various functions and message types.

See it in action here http://mds.github.io/projects/case-basis-prototype/.

This is also a good starting point for the app development.
Assets have been exported to the `assets` folder including icons, etc.

The code for the prototype can be found in `index.html` and `assets/sass/*` with most of the styles written in `global.sass`.

Colors are controlled from `variables.sass`

I compiled the Sass with Codekit, so if you don't have that you'll need to use grunt or gulp or whatever...
