        <h2>A Few Other Things I Need to Say</h2>
        <p>Here they are in all of their glory.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When you wake up in the morning</li>
          <li>After you've gotten out of the shower</li>
          <li>Clothed and ready for the day</li>
          <li>Playing outside with the kids</li>
          <li>When we go out on a date</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.</p>
        <p>I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets. Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.</p>
